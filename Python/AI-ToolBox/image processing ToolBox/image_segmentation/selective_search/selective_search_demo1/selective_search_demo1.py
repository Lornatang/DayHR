selective search demo1

read one image, call the open source library selectivesearch's api
get the region proposal boxes and display
you need to install python library selectivesearch first


Selective Search paper:
J.R.R. Uijlings, et al, Selective Search for Object Recognition, IJCV 2012

python implement on github:
https://github.com/AlpacaDB/selectivesearch

install:
$ pip install selectivesearch

    parameter explanation
    sigma:
        In general we use a Gaussian filter to smooth the image slightly before 
        computing the edge weights, in order to compensate for digitization artifacts.
        We always use a Gaussian with Ïƒ = 0.8, which does not produce any 
        visible change to the image but helps remove artifacts.
        (The smaller the sigma, the finer the segmentation result)
    
    min_size:
        If the rect size is reached on min_size, the calculation is stopped.
        
    scale:
        a larger scale causes a preference for larger components
