## A random paste tool

`random_paste_tool.py` is a random paste tool that I built to solve a data enhancement requirement in real work.

I think the idea of this tool is quite interesting, you may wish to give it a try,
if the problem you care about has the following characteristics:
    1. The sample size is small and data enhancement is required.
    2. The target object you care about always appears in a specific type of background
    3. The background image is easy to collect

Since the real scene in my work are sensitive, let us take the following scenario as an example.

Imagine that we are trying to solve a classification problem that
determine if a bird is included in a given picture.

    1. Suppose the sample of birds is very difficult to collect (although this is not the case)
    2. Images containing birds usually appear in fixed scenes (such as flowers or sky)
    3. The image of the flower is very easy to collect

In this case, we can use our tools. The general steps are:
    1. First, the target object (bird) is segmented from the image to form a object segmentation set.
    2. Then, collect a large number of background images as a background set
    3. Randomly pick a segment from the object set and paste it into a random background image.
    4. Repeat step 3 continuously, and add other data enhancement methods such as zoom, rotate, etc.

You can use the [segmentation tool](https://github.com/monkeyDemon/AI-Toolbox/tree/master/image%20processing%20ToolBox/image_segmentation/selective_search/selective_search_demo5) in our AI-Toolbox to get the object segmentation set.

I think my idea, compared to the commonly used image enhancement method,
makes more changes to the image pixels without destroying the distribution law of the real sample.
So it may get better precision and robustness, this needs to be verified by actual problems.

Here are some of the results automatically generated by the tool.
